## Project Description
E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling products on online services or over the Internet. It has been expanding every year and delivering huge contribution to the enterprisesâ€™ total revenue. There are several key performance indicators, such as bounce rate, visitor type, and pageviews per visit, for marketing to help understand how good the company is doing in relation to marketing and advertising goals. The hypothesis of this project is that it is more likely that customers end up with shopping when the page value is higher. Also, we would like to know how other features will affect the result(if the customers end up with shopping or not).
